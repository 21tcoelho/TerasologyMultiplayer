Setting Up a Multiplayer Server
- First I downloaded TerasologyLauncher.zip at https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases
- I extracted the file and opened the Terasology Launcher, starting the game
- I clicked on "Host Game", and under "Advanced" added several modules to the world such as SimpleFarming and WoodAndStone
- I then clicked on "Start Playing" to generate the world

Joining a Multiplayer Server
- To join, I opened up a second client on my computer
- I clicked on "Join Game", and under "Custom" clicked on "localhost"
- With my multiplayer server running on my former client, the connection was stable and I was able to join the world

Opinion/Thoughts
- The setup for multiplayer seemed fairly simple and surprisingly quick; I was able to have a server running in approximately 10 minutes. I don't see any way this process could be made easier, and as long as the steps above are followed there should be no errors or issues. I did not encounter any bugs during this procedure.
